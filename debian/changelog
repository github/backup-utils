  * Updates the README to explain why backup-utils is useful even if you have
    the high availability replica running. #140

github-backup-utils (2.0.2) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

    and FreeBSD. #86, #87

    long-running server processes matching /git.*gc/, causing the backup operation
    to timeout.
  * Adds a note and link to the Migrating from GitHub Enterprise v11.10.34x to
    v2.0 documentation in the README.
  * Adds example / documentation for the GHE_EXTRA_SSH_OPTS config value to the

    online and incremental backups from v11.10.341 to at least v11.10.342.
  * The ghe-restore command now prompts for confirmation of the host to restore to

    restoring to the wrong host. The prompt may be bypassed in automated scenarios
    by providing the --force option.
  * Added a -c option to ghe-restore for restoring base appliance settings in
    addition to primary datastores. See ghe-restore --help for more information.
