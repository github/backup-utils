Description: Backup and recovery utilities for GitHub Enterprise
 The backup utilities implement a number of advanced capabilities for backup
 hosts, built on top of the backup and restore features already included in
 GitHub Enterprise.
 .
 These advanced features include:
 .
 Complete GitHub Enterprise backup and recovery system via two simple utilities:
 `ghe-backup` and `ghe-restore`.
 Online backups. The GitHub appliance need not be put in maintenance mode for
 the duration of the backup run.
 Incremental backup of Git repository data. Only changes since the last
 snapshot are transferred, leading to faster backup runs and lower network
 bandwidth and machine utilization.
 Efficient snapshot storage. Only data added since the previous snapshot
 consumes new space on the backup host.
 Multiple backup snapshots with configurable retention periods.
 Backup commands run under the lowest CPU/IO priority on the GitHub appliance,
 reducing performance impact while backups are in progress.
 Runs under most Linux/Unix environments.
